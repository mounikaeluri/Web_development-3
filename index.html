<p>Active youngsters who can't get enough of the sports and athletics 
offered in after-school programs during the year can spend their 
summer vacation blowing off steam in the coolest ways possible. 
Kids' fitness centres in the city and beyond offer endless sports 
camps for kids, from a brand-new sports program,inspired acrobatics camp or swimming lessons.
 With awesome youth fitness classes and camps 
available for almost any sport you can imagine,
you'll have no problem getting little ones off the couch.</p>
<p>If you’ve been to camp, you’re not surprised to hear about the benefits of summer camp. Experiencing life at camp
 yourself as a child, you know the profound positive effects that still matter to you as an adult, 
 and you also know that you want the same thing for your own kids.
But if you didn’t go to camp as a child, you may not realize just how good the experience is for children. 
You may not know why so many parents are committed to sending their kids to camp.
<br />Camp is an independent experience that shapes one’s character and life 
 a controlled, safe environment where children and youth are able to make their own
 decisions about simple things (what activity they want to do, how many more they want 
 make, or what clothes they are going to wear) and about important things (who they will hang out
 with who will be their friends).

<div id = "basketball">
<p>
Playing basketball improves kids' motor skills.If you're looking 
for a physical activity to get your child off the couch, basketball
 is a sport that your boy or girl can start at an early age. 
 Playing basketball helps children learn basic coordination and 
 team-building skills with an added bonus of making new friends 
 along the way. Getting your child going with basic basketball
 skills at a young age not only helps encourage exercise, 
but serves as a foundation for staying active later in life.
Some basketball programs begin for children as young as 5 years old.
 For young children, programs focus on developing basic skills 
 and typically use shorter 6-foot rims. Rule-based play typically 
 does not begin until kids are 7 to 9 years old. By fourth or fifth
 grade,many kids are ready to play basketball against other teams.
 </p>
 <p>
 Children ages 6 to 17 require at least one hour of 
 moderate-intensity physical activity every day. Kids should 
 engage in vigorous-intensity physical activity three days each 
 week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
 Learning basketball allows children to incorporate frequent 
 physical activity into their daily routines and contributes to 
 overall physical well-being and fitness. In addition to 
 coach-supervised basketball camps, kids can practice at home to stay active.
</p>
<p><strong>Motor Skills:-</strong>Learning to play basketball involves dribbling, throwing, 
catching and pivoting. Beginning basketball training at a young age
 improves gross motor skills by using major muscle groups. Young 
 children who play basketball improve flexibility and endurance.
 Your child will also benefit from improved fine motor skills, such
 as hand-eye coordination.These motor skills transfer to other activities of daily life.<br />
<strong>Psychological Development:-</strong>Becoming involved with basketball at an early age helps kids 
develop psychologically. Playing on a team allows your child to
 make friends and feel involved with her peer group. Team sports 
 also improve a child's ability to communicate and solve basic 
 problems. Experiencing the benefits and difficulties of healthy 
 competition at a young age prepare children for failures later 
 in life. Basketball teaches children social skills and coping 
 strategies that are useful at school, home and in peer relationships.

<h2><span id="baseballAnchor"></span>Baseball<a id="form" href="form1.html"> <img id="name" src="signup.gif" alt="Picture For Enroll Link" /></a></h2>
<div id = "baseball">
<p>Baseball is the great American pastime! In fact, when Calvin 
 Coolidge was President he actually declared, “Baseball is our 
 national game!” So be it!In many ways the history of baseball
 and that of our country go hand-in-hand. The game has evolved 
 as we have grown as a nation; the inception of each closely 
 parallels each other. Albeit, many say baseball was derived 
 from the English game of rounders or cricket, but baseball is
 definitely a different game! Beginning with base ball(two separate
 words) and town-ball, our national game has been enmeshed with the
 growth of our country since the first shot was fired in the 
 American Revolution until the present day. As Hall of Famer
 Reggie Jackson once said, <strong>“This country is as American as baseball!”
</strong></p>
<p>“Baseball” wrote Mark Twain, “is the very symbol, the outward and visible expression of the drive and push, and rush, and struggle of the …booming 19th Century. Baseball evolved into the favorite
 American sport because it is fast-paced and physical”. Baseball 
 creates an “escape” from everyday life in both vicarious and 
 interactive ways. It is a year-long diversion that encourages
 regional competition and rivalry, free play, parent-child bonding, a respect for the past, and even “fantasy” activities. Baseball is in all the arts to include movies, television, literature, and even cartoons. It is a recreational game any one can play and enjoy for fun! Baseball’s
 best moments do not always happen on the field!</p>
 <p> Baseball provides the essential “life lessons” necessary
 in the socialization and development of good, solid productive 
 citizens; it is the best “classroom of life”. Within an 
 educational and fun environment, youngsters learn to cooperate, 
 compete, make decisions, problem solve, a strong work ethic,
 as well as the qualities of being a good sport, self-reliance,
 integrity, character, NEVER quitting, and of course, 
 the accountability and responsibility of being on a team/family.
 It also provides an environment teaching physical and mental 
 conditioning, nutrition, and personal hygiene.
 The “lessons of baseball are the lessons of life”.<br />
 Lastly, someone once said that to determine the REAL importance
 of baseball, simply put a baseball and other toys in front of an 
 infant and see which he/she will pick up first.It will be the baseball!! It is simply the FUNNEST game!
 </p>
 <p>
 Baseball has reflected the language of America and spiced it too. 
 Presidents, politicians, executives, generals and parents “touched 
 all the bases” regularly so nobody would be “out in left field” or
 “caught off base” in the great pursuits of life. If you did it right, 
 you hit a “Grand Slam home run”, if not, you “struck out”.</p>

<p>
A person who is fit is capable of living life to its fullest extent.
 Physical and mental fitness play very important roles in your 
 lives and people who are both, physically and mentally fit are 
less prone to medical conditions as well.
</p>
<p>
Fitness does not only refer to being physically fit, but also 
refers to a person"s mental state as well. If a person is 
physically fit, but mentally unwell or troubled, he or she will 
not be able to function optimally. Mental fitness can only be 
achieved if your body is functioning well. You can help relax your 
own mind and eliminate stresses by exercising regularly and eating right.
</p>
<p>
People who are physically fit are also healthier, are able to 
maintain their most optimum weight, and are also not prone to 
cardiac and other health problems. In order to maintain a relaxed
 state of mind, a person should be physically active. A person who
 is fit both physically and mentally is strong enough to face the 
 ups and downs of life, 
and is not affected by drastic changes if they take place.
</p>
<p>
Becoming physically fit requires a change in life style as well. 
You will have to incorporate a regular exercise routine in your 
life and also eat healthier. By avoiding junk foods, fizzy drinks, 
bad habits like smoking and alcohol and by getting adequate amount 
of rest, you will be able to become physically and mentally fit. 
Just by eliminating all these food substances from your life, 
no matter how temporarily, you will allow your body to detox and 
become stronger. Make sure that you spend more time outdoors in 
the sun, and fresh air and take part in more healthy activities. 
Fishing, bicycling, swimming, hiking, and even playing foot ball 
with your kids should be a part of your physically fit lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
By becoming more active you can increase your body"s fitness levels 
and also avoid health problems like diabetes and high blood pressure
 from developing. Exercise is also good 
for your joints and makes your body stronger overall.

<p>Band camp is a place to have fun while learning to play your
 instrument. While you are there to work and learn, it doesn't 
 have to be torture, and can actually be a part 
of the best days of your life, even if you don't go away!</p>
<p>Lessons, practice, and performances without the demands of school will boost your performance 
chops and knowledge faster than during the school year.<br />
After attending a summer music program, you may be fired up to major
 in music – or not. How helpful to learn this over a summer!<br />
 Get assistance from excellent faculty in anticipation of college pre-screens and auditions.<br>
 Networking is essential to success in all areas of music –– and most any career field in the 21st century. Learn to network 
 with those who will become lifelong friends and mentors.<br />
 Balance hard work with concerts, mixers, and recreational opportunities 
 in interesting and often very beautiful surroundings. </p>
 <p>
 In a lifetime of observing different groups and activities 
 where teens congregate, I can say without reservation that 
 the marching band is absolutely the least homogenous, in 
 the sense that there are kids from every part of the school
 and all different circumstances. Other activities tend to 
 bring like kids together, and somehow band is different. 
 This will put your kid with some kids they’d never meet, 
 otherwise. But the way in which they’re all alike is that 
 they’re all really good kids. They work hard in school, they 
 work hard in band, and remember how the director doesn’t 
 tolerate shenanigans? They meet that code of conduct or 
 they disappear. That’s it. There’s no nudge-nudge-wink-wink
 or “I didn’t see that” in band culture the way there is in 
 some team sports. The kids are expected to be awesome at 
 all times. As a result, most of the kids are awesome at all
 times. No, they don’t stop being teenagers, but there is a
 family atmosphere and acceptance of all among the band kids
 that I’ve yet to see anywhere else. It’s a safe place, and 
 I don’t know about your teen, but for my teen, that’s been a godsend.
</p>
<p>
Okay, maybe not everything, but the benefits of music education
 are well-documented. Being in marching band gives your teen 
 everything from a leg up on the SATs to a decreased chance
 of using drugs. Trust me, band kids don’t have time for any
 of that, anyway. Ever heard the saying that a busy teenager is a happy teenager? Band kids are busy</p></div>
<h2><span id="swimmingAnchor"></span>Swimming<a id="form" href="form1.html"> <img id="name" src="signup.gif" alt="Picture For Enroll Link" /></a></h2>
<div id="swimming">
<p>
Learning to swim is fun, provides health benefits and could save
 a child’s life. Sadly, drowning is the third most common form of 
 accidental death in children, so learning to swim really is an essential life skill.
</p>
<p>
The great thing about swimming is that children of any age, size or ability can take part – and it is more 
accessible to children with disabilities than most other sports. 
Hear what Olympic champion Rebecca Adlington has to say about learning to swim (left).
Children absolutely love swimming,with one in three saying it’s their favourite family activity.
<br />
But it's not all about having fun, there are other great reasons to get your child swimming:It keeps your child’s heart
 and lungs healthy, improves strength and flexibility, increases stamina and even improves balance and posture.
Your child will have plenty of opportunities to make friends and grow in confidence.Swimming opens the door to other 
sports and activities, including:<br /> swimming with dolphins, scuba diving, rowing and sailing and even becoming the next
 Olympic or Paralympic champion!It’s a skill that once learnt is rarely forgotten  there are even swimming events 
 for those aged over 100.Swimming provides challenges, from working through the ASA Awards to perhaps one day swimming 
 the English Channel.You can't always be there. It may save their life one day.
</p>
<p>
Swimming is also fantastic cardiovascular alternative to running, and is much easier on your children’s joints 
because there isn’t that constant foot-to-cement impact. Basically, muscles have to work harder to perform aerobic 
activity with the water resistance. As a result, they get stronger, lengthen and gain flexibility.
You heard right: your kids’ time in the pool translates to higher marks at school. Swimming has been scientifically linked
 to an better academic performance. Studies have found that children who swam during their developmental years achieved several
 physical and mental milestones faster than their non-swimming counterparts. Researchers found that the type of instruction and 
 sensory learning kids are exposed to early on in swimming lessons translates almost seamlessly into the type of learning they’ll do in the classroom.

<div id="nature">
<p>
We all want our children to be happy, healthy, and physically fit. As busy as we are, it’s important to find time to
 help children develop good habits that contribute to a lifelong focus on wellness. We may hope that feeding them nutritious 
 foods or enrolling them in gymnastics or karate classes will be enough to accomplish these goals.
Though these activities can certainly have a positive impact on health and fitness, the reality is that one of 
the best gifts we can give our children is to introduce them to the great outdoors, laying the groundwork for a life-long
 connection to the natural world.
In the recently updated, Last Child in the Woods (Louv, 2005), the author coined the term “nature-deficit disorder” to
 describe the phenomenon of children’s disconnection from the natural world. Louv notes that young people are going outside 
 much less frequently than in the past due to increased access to technology and perhaps our fears as parents as well.
And yet we know that when children are outside and surrounded by nature, they experience an ever-changing and free-flowing
 environment that stimulates all the senses. Going outside to play fosters children's intellectual, emotional, social and 
 physical development.</p>
 <p><strong>Intellectual Benefits:-</strong>The natural world is a giant, open-ended learning laboratory. Children are
 innate scientists and love to experience the sights, scents, sounds, and textures of the outdoors. Nature provides countless 
 opportunities for discovery, creativity, and problem-solving.Building and digging in dirt, watching worms wriggle through 
 the soil, gazing up at clouds, jumping in puddles, In the natural world, children think, question, make suppositions, and
 thereby develop inquisitive minds.<br /><strong>Emotional Benefits:-</strong>Being outside feels good. Children are free to 
 explore, move about, and make noise; all delightful forms of self-expression that are often restricted indoors. Being in 
 nature enables children to run, jump, hop, skip, climb, roll, and shout, which relaxes, and reduces tension, anxiety, and 
 restlessness.Researchers have found that outdoor play calms children with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder.
<br /><strong>Social Benefits:-</strong>When children play outdoors there may be opportunities to interact with new and different
 playmates. In nature, children can play alone or connect with one another, learn to share, and problem solve. In the natural 
 world, children often collaborate to make up games and rules because there are no prescribed sets of instructions. 
 Often, when involved in the natural world, even boisterous, active children may slow down and learn to focus on being gentle. They also may develop empathy and reach out
 to console a friend who seems hurt or sad.<br /><strong>Physical Benefits:-</strong>The fresh air of the natural world is 
 invigorating and offers endless opportunities for physical activity, which, in turn, builds strong bodies. Exposure to 
 sunlight means children absorb vitamin D which has many positive benefits, including contributing to a strong immune system.
 Outside,children are able to be more physically active than when they play indoors, thus burning more calories.
